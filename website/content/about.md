## **About Challenge**

The idea of the 100 Days of Kubernetes challenge was inspired by taking a similar challenge called [**100 days of code**](https://www.100daysofcode.com). 

The whole point behind all 100 Days challenges is to create a new healthy habit, quickly aquire new skill or get rid of undesired habbit.

I am now on the second round of #100DaysOfCoding and first round of #100DaysOfK8s challenges and I don't see any reason to stop.
