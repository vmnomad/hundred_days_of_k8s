## **About Challenge**

The idea of the 100 Days of Kubernetes challenge was inspired by similar challenge called **100 days of code**.

The whole point behind any of 100 Days challenges is to create a new healthy habit or get rid of undesired habbit.

I am personally now on the second round of #100DaysOfCoding challenge and I don't see any reason not to go for round 3.
