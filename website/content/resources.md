Here you can find useful resources to support you during #100Daysofk8s journey. This includes
popular training courses and different ways to connect with K8s community, seek help and support others.

<span style="font-size:14px;">*The list will be updated regularly as I progress through this challenge.</span>

&nbsp;

### **Official Training Courses**

* [Containers Fundamentals (LFS253)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/containers-fundamentals/)

    Understanding docker containers (or any other container runtimes) is an essential skill for learning Kubernetes.

* [Introduction to Kubernetes (LFS158)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/introduction-to-kubernetes/)

    It is a good place to start learning containers if you have zero experience with K8s.
    This is free training available on the popular education platform [edx.org](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-kubernetes).

* [Kubernetes Fundamentals (LFS258)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/kubernetes-fundamentals/)

    The training is highly recommended for those pursuing Certified Kubernetes Administrator certification
    The training isn't free, but it comes with the CKA exam voucher that allows you to take the exam twice.

### **Browser-based labs** 
The following resources are web-based Kubernetes labs. You would be able to complete a set of tasks and get some hands-on experience without installing a single thing.

* [Play with Kubernetes](https://training.play-with-kubernetes.com)
    
* [Katacode](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/kubernetes)


&nbsp;

### **Connect**

* [Kubernetes on Slack](https://slack.k8s.io/)
    
    This is probably the biggest community of IT professionals. My favourite channels are <span style="color:#f0b27a">**#kubernetes-novice**</span> and <span style="color:#f0b27a">**#cka-exam-prep**</span>

* [Community Forums](https://discuss.kubernetes.io)

    The official forum of the Kubernetes community

* [Offline meetups](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/topics/kubernetes/) 

    Take you connect experience offline. Find the local Kubernetes Meetup groups to join. Check upcoming events and conferences.

* [#100DaysofK8s twitter bot](https://twitter.com/100DaysOfK8s)
    
    I wrote a simple bot that will promote your progress by retweeting tweets with #100Daysofk8s hashtag. By following the bot's retweets you will be able to encourage and support others. It will also help you stick to your commitment and increase your streaks. You can even use it to seek for help or help others.
