* [#100DaysofK8s twitter bot](https://twitter.com/100DaysOfK8s)
    
    I wrote a simple bot that will promote your progress by retwitting tweets with #100Daysofk8s hashtag and by posting latest news on K8s. By following the bot's retweets you will be able to encourage and support others. It will also help you stick to your commitment and increase your streaks. You can even use it to seek for help and help others.
