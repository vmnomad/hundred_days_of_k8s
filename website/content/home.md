## <p align="center">**Few hints to help you succeed:**</p>

* Have a clear goal, e.g. 'in 100 days I want to be ready to take Kubernetes Certified Administrator exam' or 'I want to learn how to create an application using microservices architecture'
* Connect with other people.
* Support and encourage others using #100DaysOfK8s hashtag in Twitter. This will help everyone taking part in this challenge to stay motivated and will help yourself to stick to your commitment.
* Try not to take more than 2 challenges at the same time. It gets overwhelming very quick. What I learned is that focusing on 1 or 2 study subjects is way more efficient than trying to learn mulitple things simultaneously.
