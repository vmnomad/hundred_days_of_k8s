## Rules Page

The rules are very simple.

1. Spend at least 1 hour every day learning and practicing containers development and 
orchestration, and it doesn't have to be just Kubernetes

    This can be any activity - listening to a training, boostraping K8s container, trying to 
    automate some of the orchestration workflows, splitting your monolithic app into microservices. 
    
2. Tweet your progress 

    This is very important rule as it helps you keep going and motivates others to follow your way.

3. (optionally) Commit your progress to github 

    Unfortunately, tweets are limited to 160 characters and some of the progress updates are way lengthier than that. Therefore, github log seems a better option. This progress log can be useful to yourself to check your progress pace or things that you may have missed or not covered yet. This can be also useful for a recruiter checking your skills online.
