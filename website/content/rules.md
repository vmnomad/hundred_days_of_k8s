The rules are very simple:

1. Spend at least 1 hour every day learning and practising containers development and 
orchestration, and it doesn't have to be just Kubernetes.

    This can be any activity - watching a training video, bootstrapping K8s container, trying to automate some of the orchestration workflows, splitting your monolithic app into microservices. 
    
2. Tweet your progress using #100DaysOfK8s hashtag

    This is a very important rule as it helps you keep going and motivates others to follow your way. I learned that tweeting about progress every day before I go to bed was making me stick to my commitment.
